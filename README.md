# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this challenge is to create a summary dataframe of weekly and ultimately monthly city fares and total rides data for 'PyBer'. V.Isualize has given an assignment to display weekly dataframes and charts for the company 'PyBer' to understand the differences in data between various cities using dataframes and multiple-line graphs.

### Objective:
###### To apply pandas Matplotlib in jupyter notebook to create summary DataFrame of the ride sharing data by city type
###### Create a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
###### Give a final summary and recommendations of the analysis

## Results: 

#### 1. Below are the differences in ride-sharing data among different city types
##### a. Per the dataframe below, Urban cities have a higher number of in both columns of total drivers and total rides while the other two city types 'Suburban and Rural' display a lower count. 
##### b. One noticable difference for the Urban city type is that there are more drivers than there are rides. Among the three the other two city two city types have more total rides than they do total drivers.
##### c. Given the results from the data the'Average Fare per Driver' is significantly higher for Rural city types compared to Urban types on a weekly basis.

#### 2. Here is a multiple-line graph of total fares for each city type
###### a. The Urban city type showed a steady increase in fares up until third week of Feb followed by a dip in last week of that month. The Urban city fares were up and down in the month of March but was still higher by the and of Aprile compared to the beginning of the new year.
###### b. The Suburban city type also showed an increase in fares up until third week of Feb followed by a dip in last week of Feb. The Suburban city fares were stable in the month of March and started rising in April.
###### c. Rural city fares were reported the lowest but showed a steady trend through January to April with exceptions of a sudden drop in the forth week of February. Both Suburban and Rural types had a decline in the second week of April while the Urban city type increased.

## Final Summary
#### Recommendations to CEO:
##### 1. As we can see that Rural city have lower driver engagement, management can try to create a push in the Rural type cities to provide more incentive to drivers or increase demand by marketing more in the Rural areas. 
##### 2. Although Urban city types have a higher total amount of drivers, the number of rides is less than the total driver count. This indicates marketing can also be used more for riders than hiring drivers to create and better balance in average fares for urban drivers. This can be used as an incentive for business pricing fares. 
##### 3. In the last week of February there was a sharp decline in rides, management could analyze the market and see what factors might have been affecting this decline and how they might be able to improve on the data with the information provided in the future.
